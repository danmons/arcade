arcade
======
Public repo of all my arcade machine drawings and research.

Most CAD drawings should be in DXF 2000 format.  Built originally in QCAD, and then later migrated to LibreCAD.

Most artwork should be vector hopefully, or at least high res raster.  Inkscape will be the tool of choice for SVG, with finals exported to PDF for printing.
